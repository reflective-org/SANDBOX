# Deferred / follow-ups (SANDBOX)

- **Exact `aerosol.F90` port** (fractional-source OD interpolation + Ångström scaling). Not needed for
  the coupling (TOMAS supplies spectral optics directly), but required for config-static aerosol
  parity with Fortran TUV-x.
- **Longwave aerosol heating** fidelity (Phase 5) — dominant stratospheric aerosol heating term;
  outside any shortwave actinic code. Decide parameterization.
- **Trace the uniform ~1.8e-8 residual** in the extraterrestrial-flux normalization (negligible).
- **O3 QY 1:1 Fortran diagnostic** (currently validated against the analytic Matsumi recommendation).
- Remaining reaction-specific QY modules (RONO2/PAN/ketone families) for full TUV-x coverage.
